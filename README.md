# WeatherApp

WeatherApp is a mobile application built with **React Native** that provides current weather information for any location. The weather data is fetched from the **OpenWeather** API, a popular third-party web service that offers real-time weather updates.

## Features

- Search for weather information by city.
- Display current weather conditions like temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.
- Responsive and user-friendly interface.

## Technology Stack

- **React Native**: Cross-platform mobile development framework.
- **OpenWeather API**: For fetching real-time weather data.
- **Axios**: Used for handling API requests.
- **React Navigation**: For navigating between screens.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.x or above)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as the package manager.
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) (if using Expo for development)
- Android Studio / Xcode (if you plan to run it on an emulator or physical device)

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to run the project locally on your machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SoftGenics/weatherApp.git
cd weatherApp
2. Install Dependencies
Once you're inside the project directory, install the necessary dependencies by running:

If you use npm:

bash
Copy code
npm install
If you use yarn:

bash
Copy code
yarn install
3. Setup OpenWeather API
To fetch weather data, you'll need an API key from OpenWeather:

Go to OpenWeather and sign up for a free account.
After signing up, you'll get an API key. Copy this key.
Create a .env file in the root of your project directory and add the following environment variable:
bash
Copy code
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
Make sure to replace your_api_key_here with your actual API key.

4. Running the App
For Android/iOS Emulator or Physical Device
If you're using Expo CLI, you can run the following command to start the application:

bash
Copy code
npx expo start
Or

bash
Copy code
npm start
Then:

Use the Expo Go app on your phone to scan the QR code.
If you're using an emulator, you can select your target device from the Expo developer tools.
If you're not using Expo and are building the app with React Native CLI:

bash
Copy code
npm run android   # For Android
npm run ios       # For iOS
5. Running on a Physical Device
To run the application on a real device:

Make sure your device is connected to your computer.
For Android: Enable developer mode and USB debugging.
For iOS: Ensure your device is registered in Xcode.
Then run:

bash
Copy code
npm run android  # For Android devices
npm run ios      # For iOS devices (with Xcode setup)
Environment Variables
Ensure you configure the following environment variables before running the project:

bash
Copy code
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
You can use a .env file or directly replace the value in the config file where the API is called.
